# Methodology
The following projections were generated by Vanderbilt students in the Data Science for Social Good program. The scope of this project is to predict the amount of construction and demolition (C&D) debris generated over the next five years in Nashville. They paired historic C&D landfilling and recycling amounts with building permits issued from FY05-FY20 in Nashville to predict the total C&D debris expected to be generated through FY26. The model was then trained using Debris Management Reports for building permits issued in Austin, Texas and San Francisco, California.
